# QA Fintech Dashboard

This project contains API and UI automation tests for a fictional fintech dashboard.

## Day 1: Postman API Testing Setup

- Created a mock `POST /transfer` endpoint to simulate fund transfers.
- Wrote tests to validate response code and presence of `transactionId`.
- Tests exported to `/postman/collections`.

> Next step: turn this into automated CLI tests using `newman`.
